        <div class="icon">🤖</div><h3>AI Daily Intelligence</h3>
        <p>Every morning at 5am, your inbox gets a full breakdown of last night. Sales, labor, reviews, voids, manager logs — with charts and action items.</p>
        <p class="real-talk">Imagine knowing your bartender comped 14 drinks before you even wake up.</p>
        <div class="expand-hint">Click to expand ↓</div>
        <div class="service-detail"><p>Our AI pulls from Toast, 7shifts, R365, OpenTable, and Google Reviews simultaneously. It cross-references data points humans miss — like correlating high void counts with specific server shifts, or spotting labor creep before it hits payroll. Each report is customized to your concept and KPIs. No generic dashboards. Real intelligence, delivered before your first coffee.</p></div>
