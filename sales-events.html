      <h2>The <span class="gradient-text">Problem</span></h2>
    </div>
    <div class="problem-quote reveal">Your private dining room sits empty 4 nights a week. Your "sales strategy" is waiting for the phone to ring. You have no CRM, no follow-up system, and no idea which corporate accounts are worth chasing. Meanwhile, the restaurant down the street just booked a 200-person holiday party you didn't even know about.</div>
    <ul class="pain-list reveal">
      <li>No dedicated sales function — your GM is "doing sales" between managing the floor</li>
      <li>Event inquiries come in and nobody follows up within 24 hours</li>
      <li>You don't have a CRM — leads live in email threads and sticky notes</li>
      <li>No outbound strategy — you're 100% reactive, waiting for inbound</li>
      <li>Large party and private event pricing is inconsistent across managers</li>
      <li>No idea what your event revenue pipeline looks like for next month</li>

      <h2>How We <span class="gradient-text">Fix It</span></h2>
    </div>
    <div class="solution-content reveal">
      <p>We build a complete sales engine for your restaurant — from CRM setup to outbound prospecting to event execution playbooks. This isn't a marketing agency making pretty graphics. This is an operator-built revenue machine designed to fill seats and book events systematically.</p>
      <p><strong>Inbound:</strong> We set up proper lead capture, automated follow-up sequences, event inquiry forms that actually work, and response time tracking. Every lead gets touched within 2 hours — not 2 days. Your CRM tracks every interaction so nothing falls through the cracks.</p>
      <p><strong>Outbound:</strong> We identify your ideal corporate accounts, build prospect lists, create outreach sequences, and develop partnership programs. Your sales pipeline gets filled proactively — not by accident. We target companies within 5 miles, law firms, tech companies, wedding planners, corporate event coordinators, and local organizations that book recurring events.</p>
      <p><strong>Events:</strong> Standardized BEO templates, tiered pricing packages, upsell frameworks, and post-event follow-up. Every event runs the same way regardless of which manager is on. And every event generates data that feeds back into the AI for revenue forecasting.</p>
      <div class="differentiator">Our Director of Sales, Marketing and Events has built event programs that turned dead Monday-Thursday covers into the most profitable nights of the week. We don't theorize about sales — we close them.</div>

      <h2>What This <span class="gradient-text">Looks Like</span></h2>
      <p>Sample scenarios based on typical engagements.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="example-cards">
      <div class="example-card reveal">
        <div class="example-scenario">CRM & Lead Management</div>
        <div class="example-finding">A 3-location group had zero CRM. Event inquiries went to a shared email that three people monitored "when they had time." Average response time was 3.5 days. They were losing 60%+ of leads before first contact.</div>
        <div class="example-result">Implemented CRM with automated lead routing and 2-hour response SLA. Lead-to-booking conversion rate went from 12% to 38% within 60 days. Pipeline visibility gave ownership team a 6-week revenue forecast for the first time.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="example-card reveal reveal-delay-1">
        <div class="example-scenario">Outbound Corporate Sales</div>
        <div class="example-finding">Private dining room was averaging 2 bookings/month — almost entirely from walk-in inquiries. No outbound sales activity. No prospect list. No follow-up system for past event clients.</div>
        <div class="example-result">Built a prospect list of 200+ local businesses within 5 miles. Launched email outreach sequence with tiered event packages. PDR bookings went from 2/month to 11/month in 90 days. Created a recurring "Monthly Wine Dinner" series that sold out 3 months in advance.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="example-card reveal reveal-delay-2">
        <div class="example-scenario">Event Execution & Revenue</div>
        <div class="example-finding">Events were priced inconsistently — the same 40-person buyout was quoted at three different price points by three different managers. No BEOs. No standardized packages. Post-event follow-up was nonexistent.</div>
        <div class="example-result">Built 4 tiered event packages with clear pricing, minimums, and add-ons. Standardized BEO templates. Created post-event thank-you sequence that generated 34% rebooking rate. Average event revenue per booking increased 28% from upsell structure alone.</div>
