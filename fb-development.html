      <h2>The <span class="gradient-text">Problem</span></h2>
    </div>
    <div class="problem-quote reveal">Your chicken piccata costs $6.80 to plate but you're selling it at $18. Your bar is pouring at 28% and nobody's counting bottles. Your cocktail menu hasn't been re-costed since you opened. Your food cost is 37% and climbing — and your beverage program might be even worse, but you can't tell because nobody's tracking it.</div>
    <ul class="pain-list reveal">
      <li>You don't know the actual plate cost of half your food menu items</li>
      <li>Your best-selling dish might be your least profitable one</li>
      <li>Your pour cost is a guess — nobody's auditing the bar program</li>
      <li>Bartenders are free-pouring and your cocktail recipes aren't standardized</li>
      <li>Seasonal ingredients are eating your margins and nobody's adjusting</li>
      <li>Kitchen is plating by feel, bar is pouring by feel — specs drift every week</li>
      <li>No ongoing controls — even if you fix it today, it creeps back in 60 days</li>

      <h2>How We <span class="gradient-text">Fix It</span></h2>
    </div>
    <div class="solution-content reveal">
      <p><strong>Food:</strong> We deploy a Culinary Director on-site who runs a full item-level profitability audit on every dish you sell. Every plate cost, every ingredient, every portion. We rebuild recipe cards from scratch — standardized portioning, documented specs, and pricing that hits your targets. Then we train your kitchen to execute consistently and plan seasonal rotations that keep guests excited while keeping food cost locked.</p>
      <p><strong>Beverage:</strong> Our Beverage Director audits your entire bar program — every bottle, every pour, every cocktail recipe, every waste point. We redesign cocktail menus for profitability without sacrificing creativity. Build standardized recipe cards for every drink. Implement inventory systems that catch shrinkage. Renegotiate vendor contracts. Train bartenders on proper portioning and upselling techniques.</p>
      <p><strong>Controls:</strong> Here's where most consultants stop and we keep going. We install ongoing monitoring systems — AI-powered tracking of food cost, pour cost, waste, and portion drift. Daily alerts when something moves. Weekly variance reports. Your costs don't creep back because the system never stops watching.</p>
      <div class="differentiator">We're not food stylists or mixology influencers. We're a Culinary Director and Beverage Director who've developed food and cocktail programs for 4+ concepts — and we have the AI to make sure nothing drifts after we leave the building.</div>

      <h2>What This <span class="gradient-text">Looks Like</span></h2>
      <p>Sample scenarios based on typical engagements.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="example-cards">
      <div class="example-card reveal">
        <div class="example-scenario">Food Menu Audit</div>
        <div class="example-finding">We found 6 menu items running above 40% food cost. Three of them were in the top 10 sellers — bleeding money every night they were ordered. A $22 pasta dish was costing $9.10 to make.</div>
        <div class="example-result">After re-engineering recipes and portions, average plate cost dropped $1.40. The pasta went from $9.10 to $6.20 with the same guest satisfaction scores. Food cost normalized within 30 days.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="example-card reveal reveal-delay-1">
        <div class="example-scenario">Bar Program Overhaul</div>
        <div class="example-finding">Pour cost was running at 28% — industry target is 18-22%. No standardized cocktail recipes. Bartenders free-pouring spirits. Premium bottles unaccounted for. Zero inventory process beyond "we order when it looks low."</div>
        <div class="example-result">Rebuilt the entire cocktail menu with costed recipes. Implemented jigger standards and weekly inventory counts. Pour cost dropped from 28% to 19% in 8 weeks. Identified one bartender consistently over-pouring — retraining saved an estimated $400/week.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="example-card reveal reveal-delay-2">
        <div class="example-scenario">Ongoing Controls</div>
        <div class="example-finding">A location had their food cost fixed at 29% after an initial audit. Three months later it had crept back to 34%. No one noticed because reporting was monthly and manual. New cooks weren't trained on specs. Vendors had quietly raised prices.</div>
        <div class="example-result">Installed AI-powered daily food and pour cost monitoring. Automated alerts when any category drifts more than 1 point from target. Weekly variance reports flag exactly which items moved and why. Cost stayed within 0.5 points of target for 6+ months straight.</div>
